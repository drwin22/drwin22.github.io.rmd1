# Course description

Why does Sedimentology (GY306\[W\]) matter? Sediments house the record
of climate at Earth’s surface, influence climate through feedbacks, and
house important resources. In this course you will learn how sediments
are formed, moved, and preserved in the rock record. We will discuss the
way that paleoenvironments are interpreted from observations of rocks on
multiple scales. In addition, we will work together to improve your
writing skills with a focus on the genres of writing you may be expected
to do as professional geologists.

# Writing requirements

For this class to fulfill the (W) requirements of USA, you will be doing
a semester-long research project in an area related to sedimentology. To
build your skills in discipline-specific writing, we will be doing
smaller writing assignments throughout the semester. The final projects
will be peer-reviewed, revised, and then submitted for final grading and
assessment.

# Important Dates

January 17th - Last day to drop without WD  
April 1st - Last day to drop or withdraw  
See the [Academic
Calendar](https://www.southalabama.edu/academiccalendar/) for more
information.

# Course goals

1.  Observe, describe, classify, and communicate characteristics of
    sediments and sedimentary rocks.

2.  Develop a framework for building hypotheses about the distributions
    of sediments, sedimentary structures, and sedimentary environments.

3.  Communicate sedimentary geology to a variety of audiences using
    different genres of writing.

4.  Read and summarize scientific papers focused on sedimentary geology
    and related fields.

# Class textbooks

There is no required textbook for this fall, however I recommend getting
these books from the library or used versions to compliment the
lectures. Without a required textbook I will also be assigning technical
papers to read throughout the semester. We will discuss these and you
will build your technical reading skills along with your writing skills.

# Student conduct

## Attendance policy

- Students who complete less than 50% of assignments/exams will be
  assigned a failing (F) grade.

- Review the ‘Attendance and Absences Policy’, in the Undergraduate and
  Graduate Bulletin for attendance and absences policy

## Grading

### Late policy

I will be grading assignments in batches to provide fair assessment to
everyone. This means late work can be disruptive. The penalty for late
work will be 20% a day after the first 24 hours late. If you have a
reasonable excuse (illness, etc.) the late policy may be relaxed.

### Extra credit

Extra credit may be made available throughout the semester at my
discretion.

Assignments will be returned within a week of submission.

| Grade |  Range |

## Scaffolding tasks

Scaffolding writing tasks assigned to give you some practice and general
feedback to improve your writing. \### Abstract 1

First attempt at writing an abstract using the Nature paragraph
template.

### Figure Caption

Write the figure captions for several example figures using some
literature examples. Learn to describe figures in text.

### Abstract 2

Write the abstract for a second paper using the feedback from the first
abstract to improve your process.

### Peer Review

Peer review of preprint or publication using example template. The goal
of this assignment is to focus on critiquing the logic put forward in
the paper with suggestions for refining it.

## Semester project

Semester project outline of writing products.

### Project abstract

Short outline of full project highlighting the hypotheses to test, data
to collect, and impact of the project. This includes no figures but
could include a small table for organizing hypotheses.

### Project first draft

## Academic disruption policy

The University of South Alabama’s policy regarding Academic Disruption
is found in The Lowdown, the student handbook.
<http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicdisruption.shtml>.
Disruptive academic behavior is defined as individual or group conduct
that interrupts or interferes with any educational activity or
environment, infringes upon the rights and privileges of others, results
in or threatens the destruction of property and/or is otherwise
prejudicial to the maintenance of order in an academic environment. At
all times students will be cordial, courteous and respectful of faculty
members and fellow students. Cell phones, videotaping, and other
electronic devices are not allowed; however, you may use a laptop for
note taking. If your laptop is used for other purposes, the instructor
holds the right to revoke laptop use.

## Academic honesty

The University of South Alabama’s policy regarding Student Academic
Conduct Policy is found in The Lowdown
<http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicconductpolicy.shtml>: The
University of South Alabama is a community of scholars in which the
ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression,
and freedom of the individual are sustained. The University is committed
to supporting the exercise of any right guaranteed to individuals by the
Constitution and the Code of Alabama and to educating students relative
to their responsibilities.

Violation of academic conduct policy may result in receiving 0 credit
for the affected exam/assignment.

Do not pass others work off as your own. This constitutes plagiarism and
seriously undermines your education. Students may learn about the
meaning of plagiarism and how to avoid it at the following link:
<http://www.southalabama.edu/univlib/instruction/plagiarismforstudents.html>

## Course and Teacher evaluation

Student input for the purpose of course improvement is taken very
seriously and will potentially be done periodically. Please take the
time to evaluate this course and the instructor, especially at the end
of the semester. Evaluations will in no way affect your grade.

# Safety

## Field Safety

### Transportation

Wear your seatbelts at all times while in moving vehicles. Do not
distract the driver.

### Location awareness

Be aware of potential dangers (animals, weather, etc) and avoid them.
When in a group, please think about the safety of your peers.

## Building Safety

### Fire

Random fire safety drills may occur during the course of the term. You
will be expected to evacuate the building and assemble at the designated
location: outside by the northeast corner of the building (follow your
instructor).

### Tornado

Move away from external windows to the hallway in the basement, first,
or second floor.

### Active Shooter Incident

“Get Out” of the building as long as they can do so safely. Once you
have exited the building and are at a safe location, “Call Out” to law
enforcement using 911, USA Police at 460-6312, or press the Emergency
button on your LiveSafe Mobile Safety App. If you can’t get out,
“Shelter in Place” in a secure location that is away from windows and
doors, preferably a location that can be locked and barricaded.

# On writing

## Revising written work

Nothing is perfect on the first draft. We all revise and rework our
written creations for a variety of reasons. We may not communicate the
point we want to get across to all readers. We may have forgotten or not
known important pieces of information initially. The tone of the writing
may be inappropriate for the audience. Word choice might obscure
meaning. The only way we can make our writing better is by revising it
based on constructive feedback from others or ourselves.

## Genres of Science writing

### Paper reviews

Critical but constructive critique of unpublished research papers.
Informs the journal editor of how the work contributes to existing
literature and provides guide to authors and the editor for improvement
to the manuscript. Can be signed but often anonymous.

### Descriptive Reports

Descriptive reports are often made for industry or geological surveys.
These describe the composition and structure of rocks in an area.
Sometimes they include estimations of resource potentials or
environmental impacts of industry.

### Research papers

These pieces of science writing typically test one or more closely
related hypotheses in the context of existing scientific knowledge. Most
have structure that is pre-defined including: abstract, introduction,
methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Figures are an integral
part of most papers in the Geosciences and range from images of outcrops
to abstracted summaries of observations to plots of measurements.

### Conference abstracts

These are generally a step on the path to a full research publication
where results, interpretations, and context are publicly presented for
the first time.

### Grant Applications

Scientific work is generally funded with public or private funds that
are obtained by writing grants. Unlike research papers, grants must
persuade reviewers that the research planned is important, can be done
by the applicant, and can be achieved in the time frame of the funding
request.

### Science Communication

Scientists also write general summaries of their work for non-specialist
audiences. These can be blog posts, or lesson plans that are shared for
educators. Some folks also write books for general audiences describing
the processes of science.

## Common processes

For writing in the discipline, we focus on several specific questions to
guide our composition: 1) Who is our audience? 2) What is the one or two
sentence take-home point? 3) How quickly are we communicating the
information?

Science writing, like all writing, is socially situated and caries with
it the beliefs, values, and ideologies of the particular community and
culture.

## Tips and tricks for good writing

Use a citation management software to organize your papers and create
bibiliographies. My preference is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
because it is free, open source, and works across multiple operating
systems.

Write and then revise. Ask for feedback from peers or wait until you
have some distance from your writing and then revise.

Prompt yourself with questions that have short, concrete answers.

# Campus resources

## COVID policy

While on campus, students are required to follow all USA COVID-19
policies and practices. These policies can be found at
<https://www.southalabama.edu/coronavirus/>. Be advised that policies
may change during the semester, and students should check the
University’s Coronavirus Update page regularly.

There is also a student incentive program for getting vaccinated.
Details about insentives can be found at
<https://www.southalabama.edu/coronavirus/vaccineincentive/>

## Writing center

Over the course of this semester, seek help at the Writing Center if you
would like additional guidance and critique. You can access the Writing
Center at [at their
website](https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/academicsuccess/cae/how.it.works.html).
During graduate school, I found workshops and writing groups at the
Writing Center on campus to be helpful in building my motivation and
teaching me new strategies for writing efficiently.

## Disabilities

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with
bona fide disabilities will be afforded reasonable accommodations. The
Office of Special Student Services (OSSS) will certify a disability and
advise faculty members of reasonable accommodations. If you have a
specific disability that qualifies you for academic accommodations,
please notify the instructor/professor and provide certification from
the Office of Special Student Services. OSSS is located at 5828 Old
Shell Road at Jaguar Drive, (251-460-7212).

## Food insecurity

If you are subject to food insecurity, JagPantry provides a food for
students needing assistance. More information can be found [on their
website](https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/sga/foodpantry.html "JagPantry")

## Mental health

Being a university student is stressful and can negatively impact mental
health. The University Counseling and Testing Center provides
confidential, free counseling and crisis intervention services to
eligible USA students and consultation and outreach services to members
of the USA community. More information can be found [at their
website](https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/counseling/ "Counseling and Testing").

## Disaster plan

In case of Hurricane we will follow university recommendations and
off-campus accommodations will be made. Our broad goals for the semester
will continue but mode of delivery and content may change.

In case of a shift to remote learning, we will heavily rely on Canvas.
We will have at least one synchronous lecture meeting that will be
recorded and made available through Canvas. We will use digital options
for rock samples and may also use [Rockd.org](https://rockd.org/) for
local outcrop locations if we are dispersed.

# Final thoughts

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth
together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value
data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this
course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is
important, don’t be afraid to ask a question about something you don’t
know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think
you know.

**If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via Canvas
and changes will be announced in class.**
